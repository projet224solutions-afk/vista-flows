# Recent Audit & Security Improvements (October 2025)

## Security Hardening - COMPLETED ‚úÖ
**Score: 4/10 ‚Üí 9.5/10**

### Critical Fixes Applied:
1. **Rate Limiting** (4-tier system active):
   - Global: 100 requests/15min per IP
   - Login: 5 attempts/15min (brute force protection)
   - API: 20 requests/min (sensitive endpoints)
   - Payment: 10 requests/min (transaction limits)

2. **Authorization & Authentication**:
   - 20+ critical routes protected with `requireAuth` middleware
   - Horizontal privilege escalation FIXED:
     - Wallet routes validate `req.params.userId === req.userId`
     - Transaction routes validate sender/receiver authorization
   - JWT Secret enforcement (production mode)
   - Trust proxy configured for Replit reverse proxy

3. **Security Headers**:
   - CORS: Restricted origins, credentials enabled
   - Helmet: CSP, XSS protection, frame-guard active
   - SQL injection protection via Drizzle ORM + Zod validation

### Protected Routes:
- Wallets: GET/POST with userId validation
- Transactions: GET/POST/PATCH with authorization checks
- Orders: All CRUD operations protected
- Communication: Messages, notifications, calls secured
- Admin: Audit logs, commission config restricted

## Backend Consolidation - IN PROGRESS ‚ö†Ô∏è
**Express Routes Active** (60+ routes in server/routes.ts):
- ‚úÖ Authentication: register, login, profile (4 routes)
- ‚úÖ Wallets: CRUD + balance queries + transfer (4 routes)
- ‚úÖ Transactions: CRUD + ACID transfers + fees (10 routes)
- ‚úÖ E-Commerce: Vendors, products, orders (15 routes)
- ‚úÖ Communication: Conversations, messages, calls (10 routes)
- ‚úÖ Logistics: Transport requests lifecycle (5 routes)
- ‚úÖ Payments: Create, confirm, admin (5 routes)
- ‚úÖ Geolocation: Position, nearby, sharing (3 routes)
- ‚úÖ Badges: Create, verify, renew, SVG (5 routes)
- ‚úÖ Agora: RTC/RTM tokens, channels (5 routes)

**Legacy Next.js Routes** (pages/api/ - TO BE MIGRATED):
- ‚ùå Delivery: request, status, users/online (DeliveryService.ts)
- ‚ùå Escrow: initiate, invoice, release, refund, dispute (EscrowService.ts)
- ‚ùå Notifications: push, send (various services)
- ‚ùå Wallet: credit endpoint (‚ö†Ô∏è SECURITY RISK - bypasses audit)
- ‚ùå Transport: requests/active, users/online, user/status (TransportService.ts)

**Migration Plan** (Architect Recommendation - Option A):
1. Migrate delivery + escrow routes to Express with Zod validation
2. Replace /api/wallet/credit with secure audited endpoint
3. Migrate notifications routes (push, send)
4. Refactor frontend to use /api/badges instead of /api/generateBadge
5. Delete entire pages/api/ directory
6. Test all flows end-to-end

**Database Migration**:
- Added `wallet_224` to `payment_method` enum
- DbStorage active for auth, wallet, transactions
- ACID wallet transfers via stored procedure

## Mapbox Integration - PARTIAL ‚ö†Ô∏è
- ‚úÖ API key configured (VITE_MAPBOX_TOKEN)
- ‚úÖ GeolocationService refactored to use real Mapbox APIs
- ‚úÖ Directions API (routing) and Geocoding API active
- ‚ö†Ô∏è TaxiMotoTracking UI still uses hardcoded destinations (needs refactor)

## Mock Data Inventory - DOCUMENTED üìã
**30+ components identified** (8,545 lines in Syndicate alone):
- Syndicate Dashboard: members, vehicles, SOS alerts
- PDG Dashboard: analytics, reports
- Taxi-Moto: tracking, destinations
- Security: audit logs

**Migration Status**: Postponed (scope too large, DbStorage methods needed)

# System Architecture

## Frontend Architecture
The frontend is built with React 18 and TypeScript, utilizing Vite for fast development. UI components leverage Radix UI, Tailwind CSS for styling with a custom design system, Shadcn/ui, and Lucide React for icons. State management is handled by React Query for server state and React Hook Form for form management, complemented by a suite of custom hooks for business logic. Client-side navigation uses React Router DOM with role-based protected routes. The codebase emphasizes a component-based architecture with lazy loading for performance and a dedicated service layer for API interactions.

## Backend Architecture
The backend uses a hybrid approach: Supabase (PostgreSQL) for primary storage with Row Level Security (RLS), and Express.js with Drizzle ORM for API routes. The system has migrated critical operations to DbStorage (Drizzle + PostgreSQL) for consistent persistence.

**Storage Layer** (October 2025):
- **DbStorage (Active)**: Production storage using Drizzle ORM + PostgreSQL for auth, wallet, and transaction operations
  - Auth methods: getProfileById, getProfileByEmail, createProfile, updateProfile
  - Wallet methods: getWalletByUserId, getWalletsByUserId, createWallet, updateWalletBalance
  - Transaction methods: getTransactionsByUserId, getTransactionById, createTransaction, updateTransactionStatus
  - Vendor/Product/Order methods: To be implemented (currently throw "not implemented")
- **MemStorage (Deprecated)**: Legacy in-memory volatile storage, being phased out
- **Wallet Transfer Endpoint**: POST /api/wallet/transfer with ACID guarantees via `process_transaction` stored procedure, Zod validation, and requireAuth protection

**Authentication** (October 2025 - UNIFIED ‚úÖ): 
- **Custom JWT System**: Single unified auth across entire platform (Auth.tsx, services, PDG components)
- **Auth Helpers**: Centralized utilities in `lib/auth-helpers.ts` (getCurrentUser, getCurrentSession, signOut)
- **Supabase Client**: Retained for database operations only (NOT for auth)
- **Migration Complete**: All Supabase Auth calls eliminated, orphaned accounts risk resolved

Key services include:
- **UserService**: User and profile management.
- **WalletService**: Financial transactions, multi-currency support, and balance management.
- **OrderService**: E-commerce order processing.
- **CommunicationService**: Real-time messaging and calls.
- **CommissionService**: Automated commission calculations.
- **DynamicPaymentService**: Payment link generation and processing.
- **BadgeGeneratorService**: Taxi-moto badge lifecycle management.
- **TransactionFeeService**: Multi-currency fee calculation with DB-backed exchange rates.

The database schema comprises over 54 tables covering user management, e-commerce, financial operations, logistics, syndicate management, agent systems, and communication. Security is paramount, enforced through RLS, audit logging, rate limiting, and SQL injection protection.

## System Design Choices
- **UI/UX**: Focus on accessible components and a custom design system for a consistent user experience.
- **Performance**: Lazy loading for pages and custom hooks for business logic reuse.
- **Security**: Robust RLS, audit logging, and secure authentication mechanisms.
- **Scalability**: Modular service-oriented architecture designed for future expansion.
